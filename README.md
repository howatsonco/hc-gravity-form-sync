# Introduction

A plugin for storing Gravity Forms in JSON for easy version control. Made with love by Howatson+Co.

# Usage

1. Install Gravity Forms and Gravity Forms Sync plugins.
2. Create a folder labelled `gf-json` in your theme folder.
3. Done!

As you create forms, update them, and delete them, the JSON files in the `gf-json` folder will be updated automatically.
